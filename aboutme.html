        <h1>HI THERE!</h1>
        <p>My name is AJ Thomas and I am an up-and-coming web developer. I recently completed my first course in web development through Code Louisville and am excited to continue my journey in the field.<br><br>

            I have always had a passion for technology and problem-solving, and I am excited to apply those skills as a web developer. I am particularly interested in front-end development, and am eager to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
            
            I am a fast learner and am dedicated to continuously improving my skills. I am looking forward to starting my second course in January and am excited to see where this journey takes me.<br><br>
            
            In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies and building personal projects. I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate and learn from others in the tech community.<br><br>
            
            Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and help bring your ideas to life on the web.</p>
